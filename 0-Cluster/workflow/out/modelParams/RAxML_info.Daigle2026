IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 179 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns removed has already
been printed to file config/dsrAB_referenceSequences_aa.faa.reduced

Alignment has 179 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
